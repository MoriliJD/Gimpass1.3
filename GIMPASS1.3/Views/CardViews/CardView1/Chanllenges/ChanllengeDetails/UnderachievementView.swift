Parents may consult with their gifted children and give them decision-making power early on, assuming that they will become better decision-makers with practice. However, children may become confused by the expectation to think for themselves and may feel the need to disagree with their parents to make independent choices. This overempowerment may lead to frequent arguing and a need to prove intelligence through argumentation. Gifted children's self-concept is often tied closely to their intelligence, and high motivation is linked to achievement. However, if gifted children find themselves in a classroom where they do not excel, they may view certain tasks as irrelevant or useless and avoid them.

However, first and only children are also more likely to be gifted underachievers, possibly due to feelings of displacement and attention deprivation caused by the arrival of younger siblings. This extreme form of sibling rivalry is referred to as 'dethronement' and can cause a formerly positive child to become negative, aggressive, or depressed. Traumatic experiences like divorce or death in the family can also cause dethroning characteristics. Classroom environments can also contribute to feelings of displacement and underachievement.")

Families may refer to their children as the 'scholar,' 'social one,' 'athlete,' or 'creative one,' with all but the scholar underachieving academically and the scholar underachieving socially. While individual temperaments and abilities are important, competition for attention within the family also plays a crucial role in shaping children's developmental direction.")
